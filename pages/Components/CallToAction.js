                <p className='about-me'>I'm a full-stack developer and San Antonio native with a drive to create and a hunger to learn. I've got a passion for narrative, an eye for aesthetics, and a curisoity that is never satisfied, alongside an arsenal of skills and smarts that can push limits and solve problems in a snap.</p>
                
                <p className='about-me'>When I'm not coding, I love to draw, cook, play video games, or run a game of DnD with friends. On top of programming, I'm also a published writer, a freelance illustrator, a hobbyist game developer, and an irrepressible baker. I enjoy inunduating people with baked goods and taking pictures of my cat.</p>
